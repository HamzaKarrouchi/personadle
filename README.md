# 🎭 PERSONADLE

**A daily guessing game set in the Persona universe.**  
Inspired by [Smashdle](https://smashdle.net), reimagined with the flair of the **Persona** series — from P1 to P5.

Each mode offers a different way to challenge your memory and love for the franchise.  
From silhouettes and battle animations to emojis and trait analysis — can you guess today's character?

---

## 🧠 Concept

**Personadle** is a 100% front-end fan-made game created to celebrate the Persona franchise.  
The objective is simple: **guess the daily character** through various clues depending on the selected game mode.

Whether you're a Persona veteran or discovering the series, the game's stylish interface, mode diversity, and daily challenges aim to give you an exciting experience, every day.
